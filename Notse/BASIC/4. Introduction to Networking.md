## **Network Topology**
The arrangement of computers for communication and data sharing within a network is known as network topology.
There are various type of network topology :
### 1) **Bus Topology**
The topology in which computers are connected to a main cable (known as the backbone of the system) with the other computers.

**This type of topology is similar to the leaf off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.** 
 easy and more cost-efficient 
 disadvantage is because there is a single point of failure along the backbone cable. If this cable were to break

### **2) Star Topology**
A switch connects all the computer to form star topology if the switch faces problem the whole network gets trouble.
**costly and complicated
transfers data fast

### **3) Ring Topology**
The topology in which the computers are connected to each other for data sharing is known as Ring Topology.
**Transfers the data to every computer till it does not reach to the right computer.
Whole Network breaks down if any cable is damaged**

### **4) Hybrid Topology**


### **5) Mesh Topology**

# Network Devices

### **Repeater**


### **Hub**
single collision and broadcast domain
Bridge
Connect two or more network. switch is a advanced bridge.


### **Switch**
Switch helps to connect multiple computers to the network. 
multiple collision domains but broadcast domain remains the same

### **Router**
Routers are network devices that ==connect different computer networks, including local networks (LANs) and the internet==. They act as traffic controllers, deciding the best path for data packets to travel from one network to another.

## **Types of Addresses**

Devices on a network are very similar to humans in the fact that we have two ways of being identified:

- Our Name
- Our Fingerprints

We can change our name through but we can't change our fingerprints. Every human has an individual set of fingerprints which means that even if they change their name, there is still an identity behind it. Devices have the same thing: two means of identification, with one being permeable. These are:

### **IP Address**
Internet Protocol address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing.


### **Media Access Control (MAC) Address** 
This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a *MAC* (Media Access Control ) address. The MAC address is a *twelve-character* hexadecimal number (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d. The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.

# **OSI Model**
### **1. Physical layer**

















### **2. Data link layer**
work on the basis of mac address
### **3. Network layer**
incapsulate src ip destination ip  ---> packet
### **4. Transport layer**
data in this layer is called segnment
### **5. Session layer**
### **6. Presentation layer**
first compress
then translates to bits
and then encryption (ssl protocol)

### **7. Application layer**
ftp,smtp,ssh,telnet,dhcp,dns,http,https

Things to learn
A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices

Attenuation in networking refers to ==the loss of signal strength as it travels through a transmission medium, whether wired or wireless==.

# SUBNETTING

1 - ON
0 - OFF

Computers are all about Bits (1 and 0).

Work on binary and decimal conversion

				    192  .  168  .  10   .   0  
				11000000 . 10101000.00001010.00000000

## Subnet mask
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used in conjunction with an IP address to define the network and host portions of that address.

## CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing )
CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a method for allocating IP addresses and representing network ranges.

/24 - Default Class C CIDR

## VSLM
This method help you to provide usable host in efficient way.
