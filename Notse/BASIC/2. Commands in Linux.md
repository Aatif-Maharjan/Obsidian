umask - It is used to change the default permission of a file or directory
The default file permission is 664 and directory is 775.
Concept of umask
If umask results to 002 it refers to deduction of default permission.
777-002=775(rwxrwxr-x)
umask value 022
664 - 022 = 622(rw-r--r--)
Important point - Umask acutally deducts the default premission and also it remove the actual permission
